# Presidential Speech Word Tree Analysis

Python-based tokenization and data processing system for analyzing 1,056 presidential speeches and creating interactive word tree visualizations.

## Overview

This project analyzes presidential speeches to build hierarchical word trees showing word sequences that follow (or precede) specific root words. The output is formatted for D3.js visualization with metadata for color coding by historical era or speaker.

The project is broken into two parts:

- **Preprocessing**: Done in Python; cleans the raw speech data (see [here](preprocessing/) for more information)
- **Visualization**: Done in JavaScript with D3.js; creates word tree visualization from the processed data (see [here](visualization/) for more information)

## Features

- **Bidirectional Analysis**: Track words both before and after root words
- **Historical Context**: Speeches categorized into 9 historical eras
- **Case-Insensitive Matching**: Captures all variations of root words
- **Rich Metadata**: Era and speaker distributions at each tree node
- **D3.js Ready**: Output formatted for hierarchical D3.js layouts

## Dataset
