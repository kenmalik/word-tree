# Data Preprocessor

## Dependencies

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Standard library only (no external packages required)

## Usage

### Running the Analysis

```bash
python3 main.py
```

This will:
1. Load all 1,056 speeches from `speeches/` directory
2. Process each root word (we, must, freedom, fear, never)
3. Build word trees for both "after" and "before" directions
4. Drop stop words (e.g. "the", "and", "in")
5. Export results to `output/word_tree_data.json`

### Output Format

The output JSON has the following structure:

```json
{
  "root_words": {
    "freedom": {
      "after": {
        "name": "freedom",
        "children": [
          {
            "name": "and",
            "value": 429,
            "metadata": {
              "eras": {
                "Cold War": 150,
                "Modern Era": 120,
                ...
              },
              "speakers": {
                "Ronald Reagan": 45,
                "Barack Obama": 38,
                ...
              }
            },
            "children": [...]
          }
        ]
      },
      "before": { ... }
    }
  },
  "metadata": {
    "total_speeches": 1056,
    "date_range": ["1789-04-30", "2026-02-28"],
    "eras": [...],
    "presidents": [...]
  }
}
```

### Node Structure

Each tree node contains:
- `name`: The word at this position
- `value`: Number of occurrences (for node sizing in D3.js)
- `metadata`: Era and speaker distributions (for color coding)
- `children`: Array of child nodes (words that follow)

## Example Word Sequences

From the "we" root word analysis:

**After "we":**
- we → have → to → do
- we → are → not → going → to
- we → will → not → be
- we → must → be → prepared
- we → can → do → it

**Before "we":**
- [words] → [words] → [words] → [words] → we

## Implementation Details

### Tokenization
- Simple whitespace splitting
- Punctuation preserved initially, stripped for matching
- Case-insensitive matching (we = We = WE)

### Tree Building
- Context window: 5 words before/after root
- Hierarchical aggregation with occurrence counting
- Metadata attached at each node level
- Trees sorted by occurrence count (most common first)

### Color Coding Options

Use the metadata to color branches by:
- **Era**: Assign colors to historical periods
- **Speaker**: Highlight contributions from specific presidents
- **Frequency**: Gradient based on occurrence count

### Interactive Features

- Toggle between "after" and "before" directions
- Filter by era or speaker
- Expand/collapse tree branches
- Hover for details (full phrase, metadata)
- Search for specific word sequences
